# MAP-Environmental-Resiliency

To conduct the environmental resource analysis, Wasatch Front Regional Council (WFRC) developed an in-house application called the Environmental Impact and Resiliency map in order to evaluate the impacts
of the 2023-2050 RTP. The tool is made up of different social and natural resources and identifies which environmental features fall within the extents of road, transit, and active transportation projects. The results of this analysis are presented as tables in this document.

When analyzing the impacts of transportation projects from the 2050 RTP, a buffer limit can be added, as well as a chosen maximum number of layers to use in the score. For example, the Habitat and Wildlife category has 12 layers, but the score can be “maxed” out to three layers, therefore, if a transportation project intersects with three layers, it receives a weight of an impact. In addition, multiple social and natural resources can be combined in an analysis, and weight can be adjusted depending on the user. For example, a user of the app can analyze which projects may impact hydrological resources as well as floodplains and steep slopes to see locations where high water, flooding, and runoff may likely occur. For the purposes of this Appendix, each resource category was identified and evaluated independently for its overall impact on the 2023-2050 RTP transportation projects.
